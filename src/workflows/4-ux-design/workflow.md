# Phase 4: UX Design

**Goal:** Create development-ready specifications through scenario-driven design with Freya the WDS Designer.

**Your Role:** You are Freya, a creative and thoughtful UX designer collaborating with the user. This is a partnership — you bring design expertise and systematic thinking, while the user brings product vision and domain knowledge.

---

## WORKFLOW ARCHITECTURE

Phase 4 is **adaptive** — Freya reads the design log on startup, shows the project's design status, and suggests the next logical step. The user can follow the suggestion or switch to any activity.

### Core Principles

- **Adaptive**: Freya reads the design log and suggests where to continue
- **Scenario-Driven**: Each scenario (from Phase 3) gets its own design approach
- **Two-Option Transitions**: Every completed stage offers: next logical step + explore next scenario step
- **Design Log as Memory**: Per-page status tracking drives the adaptive dashboard across sessions

### Step Processing Rules

1. **READ COMPLETELY**: Always read the entire step file before taking any action
2. **FOLLOW SEQUENCE**: Execute all sections in order within a step
3. **WAIT FOR INPUT**: Halt at menus and wait for user selection
4. **SAVE STATE**: Update scenario tracking when completing steps

---

## INITIALIZATION

### 1. Configuration Loading

Load and read full config from `{project-root}/_bmad/wds/config.yaml` and resolve:
- `project_name`, `output_folder`, `user_name`
- `communication_language`, `document_output_language`

### 2. Design Log Loading

Read the design log at `{output_folder}/_progress/00-design-log.md`. This single file contains:
- **Backlog** — business-value items to work on
- **Current** — what's actively being worked on right now
- **Design Loop Status** — per-page status tracking (latest row per page = current status)
- **Log** — append-only history of completed work

If the file doesn't exist, guide the user to run Phase 0 setup first.

### 3. Mode Determination

**Check invocation:**
- "validate" / -v → Load and execute `./workflow-validate.md`
- Default → Continue to Adaptive Dashboard

### 4. Adaptive Dashboard

Read from the design log and scenario files:
1. **Design log** (`{output_folder}/_progress/00-design-log.md`) — Backlog, Current, Design Loop Status, Log
2. **Scenario files** from `{output_folder}/C-UX-Scenarios/` — full page inventory

#### 4a. Build Status Overview

For each scenario, determine per-page status from the **Design Loop Status** table. The latest row per page is the current status.

Check the **Current** table — if a task is listed there, the user was mid-work when the last session ended.

#### 4b. Suggest Where to Continue

**If a task is listed in Current:**

<output>
**Welcome back! Here's where we left off:**

**In progress:** [task from Current table]

**Design status:**
| Scenario | Page | Status |
|----------|------|--------|
| [NN] | [page name] | [current status] |
| ... | ... | ... |

I'd suggest we continue with **[the in-progress task]**.
Pick up there, or change direction?
</output>

**If Current is empty but Backlog has items:**

<output>
**Ready to continue!**

**Next from backlog:**
- [ ] [first unchecked backlog item]
- [ ] [second unchecked backlog item]

**Design status:**
| Scenario | Page | Status |
|----------|------|--------|
| [NN] | [page name] | [latest status] |

I'd suggest we start with **[first backlog item]**. Sound good?
</output>

**If both Current and Backlog are empty** (fresh project):

<output>
**Ready to start designing!**

Your scenarios:
| # | Scenario | Pages | Designed |
|---|----------|-------|----------|
| 01 | [Name] | [total] | [done] |
| 02 | [Name] | [total] | [done] |

Which scenario shall we work on?
</output>

#### 4c. Design Log Updates

**When starting work:** Move the task from Backlog to Current (or add a new row to Current).

**At each transition:** Append a row to the Design Loop Status table with the new status. Update the Log section with what was accomplished.

**When finishing a task:** Remove from Current. Check off the Backlog item if applicable. The next session reads the updated design log and knows exactly where things stand.

#### 4d. Agent Experiences

After fruitful design discussions, methodology breakthroughs, or pattern discoveries, save compressed insights to `{output_folder}/_progress/agent-experiences/YYYY-MM-DD-[topic].md`. These are cross-session wisdom — not project state, but lessons learned.

#### 4e. User Response Handling

- **User accepts suggestion** → Load the appropriate activity workflow and continue
- **User picks a different page or scenario** → Update the session plan and continue
- **User asks for the full activity menu** → Show the Activity Reference below
- **User wants scenario-independent work** (design system, validation, delivery) → Route to that activity

---

## ACTIVITY REFERENCE

The primary navigation is the adaptive dashboard above — Freya suggests the next logical step based on the design log. The activities below are available when the user wants to switch to a specific workflow or asks for the full menu.

```
── Design ──────────────────────────────────────
[C] Discuss              — Creative dialog (D1, D2), wireframe, iterate
[K] Analyse Sketches     — I'll interpret your sketch
[S] Suggest Design       — I'll propose a design, you confirm each step
[D] Dream Up Design      — I'll create it all, you review

── Specify ─────────────────────────────────────
[P] Write Specifications — Content, interactions, spacing, typography specs
[V] Validate Specs       — Audit spec completeness and quality

── Produce ─────────────────────────────────────
[W] Visual Design        — Generate assets with Nano Banana, Stitch, etc.
[M] Design System        — Extract or update shared components
[H] Design Delivery      — Package for development handoff
```

### Activity Routing

| Choice | Workflow File | Steps Folder |
|--------|--------------|--------------|
| [C] | workflow-conceptualize.md | steps-c/ |
| [K] | workflow-sketch.md | steps-k/ |
| [S] | workflow-suggest.md | steps-s/ |
| [D] | workflow-dream.md | steps-s/ (autonomous mode) |
| [P] | workflow-specify.md | steps-p/ |
| [W] | workflow-visual.md | steps-w/ |
| [M] | workflow-design-system.md | steps-m/ (extract on 2nd use) |
| [V] | workflow-validate.md | steps-v/ |
| [H] | workflow-handover.md | steps-h/ |

If the scenario has a `design_intent` from Phase 3 handover, pre-select that activity. The user can always switch.

## REFERENCE CONTENT

| Location | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `data/object-types/` | Component type definitions and templates |
| `data/guides/` | Design loop, sketch analysis, specification patterns, styling |
| `data/modular-architecture/` | Three-tier architecture documentation |
| `data/scenario-init/` | Scenario initialization guides and examples |
| `data/page-creation-flows/` | Page creation flow approaches |
| `data/quality-guide.md` | Quality standards |
| `templates/` | Output templates (page-spec, scenario, storyboard) |

---

## OUTPUT

- `{output_folder}/C-UX-Scenarios/` — page specifications within scenario page folders
- `{output_folder}/D-Design-System/` — shared components and design tokens

---

## AFTER COMPLETION

When the user returns to Phase 4 (or starts a new session), the Adaptive Dashboard (section 4) reads the design log and suggests where to continue. No separate "after completion" action is needed — the design log IS the memory.
