# 7. Reference Trigger Map for Scenario

**Purpose:** Identify the relevant Trigger Map nodes for this scenario before sketching

---

## Why Now?

You've defined:
- Feature that delivers value
- Entry point
- Mental state
- Mutual success
- Shortest path

**Perfect time to anchor the scenario to the Trigger Map.** Pick the specific business goal, persona, and driving forces that apply to this scenario.

## Agent Instructions

> "Before we start sketching, let's identify the Trigger Map context for this scenario.
>
> From your Trigger Map, which of these apply to this scenario?
> - **Business Goal** — which goal does this scenario serve?
> - **User** — which persona is this scenario for?
> - **Driving Forces** — which positive and negative drivers are most relevant?
>
> This anchors every design decision to strategy."

## Process

1. **Load the Trigger Map** from `{output_folder}/B-Trigger-Map/00-trigger-map.md`
2. **Present the business goals** — ask which one this scenario primarily serves
3. **Present the personas** — confirm which persona this scenario targets
4. **Present driving forces** for that persona — ask which 2-4 are most relevant here
5. **Summarize** the selected context

This is a **selection exercise**, not a workshop. It takes 2-3 minutes.

## Save Context

Note the selected Trigger Map context in the scenario overview file:

```markdown
## Trigger Map Context

**Business Goal:** [selected goal from Trigger Map]
**Persona:** [selected persona]
**Key Driving Forces:**
- Positive: [selected positive drivers]
- Negative: [selected negative drivers]
```

## If No Trigger Map Exists

If the Trigger Map hasn't been created yet:
- Inform the user: "There's no Trigger Map for this project yet. I'd recommend completing Phase 2 (Trigger Mapping) first — it gives us the strategic foundation for design decisions."
- If the user wants to proceed anyway, use whatever business context is available from the Product Brief and note the gap.

---

## Next Step

**Start sketching the scenario journey!**

Each sketch should:
- Serve the selected driving forces
- Support the shortest path to mutual success
- Address the target persona's needs

*Strategic context identified — now sketch with purpose!*
