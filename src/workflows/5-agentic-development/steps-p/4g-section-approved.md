# Step 4g: Section Approved & Next Steps

## STEP GOAL:

Finalize section approval and determine next action. Update status and move forward.

## MANDATORY EXECUTION RULES (READ FIRST):

### Universal Rules:

- 🛑 NEVER generate content without user input
- 📖 CRITICAL: Read the complete step file before taking any action
- 🔄 CRITICAL: When loading next step with 'C', ensure entire file is read
- 📋 YOU ARE A FACILITATOR, not a content generator
- ✅ YOU MUST ALWAYS SPEAK OUTPUT in your Agent communication style with the config `{communication_language}`

### Role Reinforcement:

- ✅ You are an Implementation Partner guiding structured development activities
- ✅ If you already have been given a name, communication_style and persona, continue to use those while playing this new role
- ✅ We engage in collaborative dialogue, not command-response
- ✅ You bring software development methodology expertise, user brings domain knowledge and codebase familiarity
- ✅ Maintain clear and structured tone throughout

### Step-Specific Rules:

- 🎯 Focus only on updating story file status, updating work file, checking progress, and routing to next section or finalization
- 🚫 FORBIDDEN to begin next section without updating status files
- 💬 Approach: Celebrate completion, update records, present progress and next steps
- 📋 If more sections remain, loop back to Step 4a; if all complete, proceed to Step 5

## EXECUTION PROTOCOLS:

- 🎯 Section status updated, progress reported, next action determined
- 💾 Update story file status and work file
- 📖 Reference work file for section progress tracking
- 🚫 Do not skip status updates

## CONTEXT BOUNDARIES:

- Available context: Approved section; work file with section plan
- Focus: Status updates and routing
- Limits: No new implementation
- Dependencies: User has approved the section (from Step 4d)

## Sequence of Instructions (Do not deviate, skip, or optimize)

### 1. Section Approved

Acknowledge user approval and announce status update.

### 2. Update Story File Status

Update `stories/[View].[N]-[section-name].md` with:
- Status: Complete
- Completed date
- Implementation summary (objects, issues, improvements, time)

### 3. Update Work File

Update `work/[View]-Work.yaml` with section status, completed date, actual time, issues encountered, and improvements made.

### 4. Check Progress

Count sections: total, completed, remaining.

### 5a. If More Sections Remain

Present progress, announce next section, and ask if ready to continue.

**If user says "Y"**: Go back to **Step 4a** (`4a-announce-and-gather.md`)
**If user says "N"** or wants to pause: Save state and acknowledge pause.

### 5b. If All Sections Complete

Announce completion of all sections and present summary of files created and states covered. Suggest proceeding to Phase 5 for integration testing.

### 6. Present MENU OPTIONS

Display based on status:
- **If more sections**: "[C] Continue to Step 4a: Announce and Gather (next section)"
- **If all complete**: "[C] Continue to Step 5: Finalization"

#### Menu Handling Logic:
- IF C (more sections): Update agent dialog, then load, read entire file, then execute `{workflow_path}/steps-p/4a-announce-and-gather.md`
- IF C (all complete): Update agent dialog, then load, read entire file, then execute {nextStepFile}
- IF Any other comments or queries: help user respond then [Redisplay Menu Options]

#### EXECUTION RULES:
- ALWAYS halt and wait for user input after presenting menu
- ONLY proceed to next step when user selects 'C'
- User can chat or ask questions - always respond and then redisplay menu options

## CRITICAL STEP COMPLETION NOTE

ONLY WHEN status files are updated and user has chosen to continue will you then load and read fully the appropriate next step file to execute.

## 🚨 SYSTEM SUCCESS/FAILURE METRICS

### ✅ SUCCESS:
- Story file status updated to complete
- Work file updated with section status
- Progress reported to user
- Correct routing (next section or finalization)

### ❌ SYSTEM FAILURE:
- Not updating story file status
- Not updating work file
- Skipping progress report
- Routing incorrectly (wrong next step)

**Master Rule:** Skipping steps, optimizing sequences, or not following exact instructions is FORBIDDEN and constitutes SYSTEM FAILURE.
