# Phase 5: Agentic Development

**Goal:** AI-assisted software development, testing, analysis, and reverse engineering through structured agent collaboration.

**Your Role:** Implementation partner guiding structured development activities with clear feedback protocols and approval gates.

---

## WORKFLOW ARCHITECTURE

Phase 5 is **menu-driven**, not linear. The user picks an activity.

### Core Principles

- **Activity-Based**: Pick the right activity for the current need
- **Non-Linear**: Start anywhere, switch between activities freely
- **Design Log Driven**: Every activity reads/updates the design log for state tracking
- **Specification as Truth**: All work traces back to approved specifications

### Step Processing Rules

1. **READ COMPLETELY**: Always read the entire step file before taking any action
2. **FOLLOW SEQUENCE**: Execute all sections in order within a step
3. **WAIT FOR INPUT**: Halt at menus and wait for user selection
4. **SAVE STATE**: Update design log when completing steps

## INITIALIZATION

### 1. Configuration Loading

Load and read full config from `{project-root}/_bmad/wds/config.yaml` and resolve:
- `project_name`, `output_folder`, `user_name`
- `communication_language`, `document_output_language`

### 2. Design Log

Read `{output_folder}/_progress/00-design-log.md`. Check Current and Backlog for context.

### 3. Activity Menu

Present:

```
What would you like to do?

[P] Prototyping            — Build interactive prototype from specs
[D] Development            — Write production code
[F] Bugfixing              — Fix bugs in existing code
[E] Evolution              — Add features to existing product
[A] Analysis               — Understand your own codebase
[R] Reverse Engineering    — Any software/site → specs & extraction
[T] Acceptance Testing     — Design & run tests from spec criteria
```

### Activity Routing

| Choice | Workflow File | Steps Folder |
|--------|--------------|--------------|
| [P] | workflow-prototyping.md | steps-p/ |
| [D] | workflow-development.md | steps-d/ |
| [F] | workflow-bugfixing.md | steps-f/ |
| [E] | workflow-evolution.md | steps-e/ |
| [A] | workflow-analysis.md | steps-a/ |
| [R] | workflow-reverse-engineering.md | steps-r/ |
| [T] | workflow-acceptance-testing.md | steps-t/ |

## REFERENCE CONTENT

| Location | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `data/guides/` | Development guides, protocols, analysis |
| `data/testing-guide.md` | Acceptance testing guide |
| `data/test-result-templates.md` | Test result templates |
| `data/issue-templates.md` | Issue reporting templates |
| `templates/` | Page, story, work file, roadmap templates |

## OUTPUT

Activity-specific output in project structure.

## AFTER COMPLETION

Each activity workflow has its own explicit design log reporting points. See the individual workflow files for details on what to log and where.
