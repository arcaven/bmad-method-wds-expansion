## Design Loop Status

> Per-page design progress. Updated by agents at every design transition.

| Scenario | Step | Page | Status | Updated |
|----------|------|------|--------|---------|

**Status values:** `discussed` → `wireframed` → `specified` → `explored` → `building` → `built` → `approved` | `removed`

**How to use:**
- **Append a row** when a page reaches a new status (do not overwrite — latest row per page is current status)
- **Read on startup** to see where the project stands and what to suggest next
