**Purpose**: Help user articulate how they envision the solution working

---

## Instruction

Explore how they see it working.

**Reference**: `{installed_path}/substeps/02-explore-sections/workflow.md` (Section 3: How We See It Working)

**Questions to explore**:
- "How do you envision this working?"
- "What's the general approach?"
- "Walk me through how you see it addressing the realization"
- "What's the core concept?"

**Keep it brief** - High-level overview, not detailed specifications

**Flexible language** - Works for software, processes, services, products, strategies
