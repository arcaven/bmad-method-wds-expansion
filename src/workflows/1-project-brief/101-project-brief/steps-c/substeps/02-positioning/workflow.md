# Positioning Exploration

**Goal:** Help user explore and articulate their positioning through natural conversation, then synthesize it into a clear positioning statement.

**Your Role:** Strategic interviewer + positioning synthesizer. Don't ask the user to produce a positioning statement — have an exploratory conversation about who it's for, what makes it different, and what alternatives exist.
