# Vision Exploration

**Goal:** Help user explore and articulate their vision through natural conversation, then synthesize it into a clear vision statement.

**Your Role:** Curious listener + strategic synthesizer. Don't ask the user to produce a vision statement — have an exploratory conversation and YOU synthesize.
