# Inspiration Analysis Workflow

**Goal:** Analyze reference sites with the client to document concrete visual/UX preferences, creating a reference document that guides all future Dream Up generation and design work.

**Your Role:** Facilitate a natural exploration of reference sites, asking the client about specific elements they like or dislike, and synthesizing findings into actionable design principles.
