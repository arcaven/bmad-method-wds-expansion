# VTC Selection Workshop - Entry Point

**Purpose:** Extract Value Trigger Chain from existing Trigger Map

**Duration:** 10-15 minutes (estimated - ALPHA)

**Steps:** 7 sequential micro-steps

---

## ⚠️ Alpha Workshop

**Not yet validated in real projects.**

Please note in your VTC file:
- Actual time taken
- Trigger Map gaps discovered
- Steps that were unclear

Your feedback improves this for everyone.

---

## Agent Instructions

**Execute steps sequentially. Do not skip steps.**

Each step:
1. References Trigger Map data
2. User selects from available options
3. Validates selection makes sense
4. Captures with source attribution
5. Moves to next step ONLY when complete

**Step 7 (Refinement) may be skipped if VTC is complete as-is.**

**Do not look ahead. Execute one step at a time.**

---

## Workshop Overview

We'll select VTC elements from your Trigger Map:

1. **Load Trigger Map** - Access existing strategic work (1 min)
2. **Select Business Goal** - Which goal for this VTC? (2 mins)
3. **Select User** - Which target group? (2 mins)
4. **Select Driving Forces** - Which 2-5 forces matter here? (5 mins)
5. **Define Solution** - What are we building? (2 mins)
6. **Position Customer Awareness** - Where do they start/end? (3 mins)
7. **Refine (Optional)** - Add/adjust anything? (5 mins)

**Advantage:** Leveraging research already done, maintaining consistency

## Agent Tips

**Selecting vs. Creating:**
- Don't imagine — SELECT from map
- Maintain consistency with priorities
- Don't include everything (focus!)

**Help User Focus:**
If user wants too many driving forces:
> "The Trigger Map captures everything. This VTC needs to focus on what THIS solution specifically addresses."

**Validate Against Map:**
- Selected low-priority items? Ask why
- Skipped high-priority items? Understand reasoning
- Document selection rationale

**When to Update Map vs. VTC:**
- Update VTC only: minor wording, solution-specific refinements, awareness positioning
- Consider updating Trigger Map: new driving force, priority shifts, new user insight

---

## Common Scenarios

**Product Pitch (Simple):** Need one primary VTC. Select highest-priority goal + user + top 2-3 forces. ~10 minutes.

**Multiple Scenarios (Complex):** Run selection for each scenario. VTCs may share business goal but have different users, forces, solutions, awareness progressions.

**Discovered Gap in Trigger Map:** Minor gap → add to VTC, note for map update later. Major gap → pause, run mini map update, return to selection.

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| User wants ALL driving forces | "The map has them all. This VTC focuses on the subset THIS solution addresses." |
| Selected forces don't match solution | "Does [solution] actually help user [driving force]? If not, remove it." |
| No priorities in Trigger Map | Use workshop to assess. Note: "Priorities defined during VTC selection." |
| Multiple goals equally important | Choose one primary. Note secondary. Can create additional VTCs. |
