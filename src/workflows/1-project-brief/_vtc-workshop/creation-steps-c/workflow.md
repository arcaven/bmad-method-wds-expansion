# VTC Creation Workshop - Entry Point

**Purpose:** Create Value Trigger Chain from scratch (no Trigger Map)

**Duration:** 20-30 minutes (estimated - ALPHA)

---

## ⚠️ Alpha Workshop

**Not yet validated in real projects.**

Please note in your VTC file:
- Actual time taken
- Steps that were unclear
- What you wish you'd known

Your feedback improves this for everyone.

---

## Agent Instructions

**Execute steps sequentially. Do not skip steps.**

Each step:
1. Completes one atomic task
2. Validates before proceeding
3. Captures output in working document
4. Moves to next step ONLY when complete

**Do not look ahead. Execute one step at a time.**

---

## Workshop Overview

We'll create the strategic chain by answering 5 key questions:

1. **Business Goal** - What success looks like (5 mins)
2. **Solution** - What we're building (2 mins)
3. **User** - Who will use it (5 mins)
4. **Driving Forces** - What motivates them (10 mins)
5. **Customer Awareness** - Where they start/end (5 mins)

**Output:** A complete VTC ready to guide design decisions

## Begin Workshop

**→ Start with [Step 1: Define Business Goal](./step-01-define-business-goal.md)**

---

## Agent Tips

**Momentum:**
- Don't let user get stuck on perfection
- "We can refine later, let's capture first version"
- Move through steps at steady pace

**Follow-up Questions:**
- If answer is vague: "Can you be more specific?"
- If stuck: "What would [user name] say about this?"
- If too broad: "If you had to pick ONE, which matters most?"

**Validation:**
- Quick checks at each step
- Catch issues early
- Build confidence

**Focus:**
- One VTC at a time
- One primary user
- 2-5 driving forces (not 20)

---

## Common Questions

**Can I have multiple users?**
For a single VTC, focus on ONE primary user. Create additional VTCs for other users.

**Can business goals change?**
Yes! VTCs evolve as you learn. Version them: vtc-v1.yaml → vtc-v2.yaml.

**How many driving forces?**
Minimum 2 (one positive, one negative). Sweet spot 4-5 total. Maximum 7-8. Quality over quantity.

**What if I'm not sure about Customer Awareness?**
Make your best guess and test. Adjust VTC based on what you learn.

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Can't think of driving forces | Ask: "What does success look like? What frustrates them? What would make them switch?" |
| Too many forces (scattered) | "Which 3 matter MOST?" Look for themes. Focus ruthlessly. |
| Generic statements ("save time") | "Save time doing WHAT specifically?" Dig deeper for real motivation. |
| Can't define customer awareness | "Do they know the problem?" → Start there. "What should they know after?" → End point. |
