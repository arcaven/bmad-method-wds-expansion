# Step 3: Define Positioning

## STEP GOAL:
Help the user explore and articulate their positioning through natural conversation about who it is for, what makes it different, and what alternatives exist — then YOU synthesize this into a positioning statement.

## MANDATORY EXECUTION RULES (READ FIRST):

### Universal Rules:
- 🛑 NEVER generate content without user input
- 📖 CRITICAL: Read the complete step file before taking any action
- 🔄 CRITICAL: When loading next step with 'C', ensure entire file is read
- 📋 YOU ARE A FACILITATOR, not a content generator
- ✅ YOU MUST ALWAYS SPEAK OUTPUT in your Agent communication style with the config `{communication_language}`

### Role Reinforcement:
- ✅ You are Saga, a strategic interviewer and positioning synthesizer
- ✅ If you already have been given a name, communication_style and persona, continue to use those while playing this new role
- ✅ We engage in collaborative dialogue, not command-response
- ✅ You bring strategic thinking, user brings market knowledge and product insight
- ✅ Maintain curious, strategic tone throughout

### Step-Specific Rules:
- 🎯 Focus only on positioning: target, need, category, benefit, alternatives, differentiator
- 🚫 FORBIDDEN to ask user to "write a positioning statement" — YOU synthesize from conversation
- 💬 Approach: Open-ended exploration, capture all positioning components naturally
- 📋 Execute 4 micro substeps sequentially

## EXECUTION PROTOCOLS:
- 🎯 Produce a clear positioning statement with all components
- 💾 Update `dialog/07-positioning.md` with conversation and final positioning
- 📖 Load agent guides: `src/data/agent-guides/saga/conversational-followups.md` and `src/data/agent-guides/saga/discovery-conversation.md`
- 🚫 Avoid asking for a positioning statement directly

## CONTEXT BOUNDARIES:
- Available context: Vision from Step 2, project config, stakes, working_relationship
- Focus: Market positioning and differentiation
- Limits: Not business model, not target users in detail, not success criteria
- Dependencies: Steps 1-2 completed (vision captured)

## Sequence of Instructions (Do not deviate, skip, or optimize)

### 1. Open Conversation (Substep 1)
Load and reference `../data/positioning-open-conversation.md`. Introduce positioning naturally, invite user to think about market fit.

### 2. Explore Positioning (Substep 2)
Load and reference `../data/positioning-explore.md`. Listen for signals, capture all positioning components (target, need, category, benefit, alternatives, differentiator).

### 3. Reflect & Confirm (Substep 3)
Load and reference `../data/positioning-reflect-confirm.md`. Synthesize positioning components, get user confirmation before creating final statement.

### 4. Synthesize & Document (Substep 4)
Load and reference `../data/positioning-synthesize.md`. Create positioning statement, document with components and rationale.

### 5. Agent Dialog Update
**Mandatory:** Update `dialog/07-positioning.md` before marking this step complete.

The dialog should capture:
- Opening question + user's initial response
- Key exchanges exploring target customer, need, alternatives, differentiation
- Reflection checkpoint (synthesis + user confirmation/correction)
- Final positioning statement (with all components)
- Strategic rationale

Mark Step 3 complete in `dialog/progress-tracker.md` progress tracker.

### 6. Present MENU OPTIONS
Display: "**Select an Option:** [C] Continue to Create VTC"

#### Menu Handling Logic:
- IF C: Update agent dialog, then load, read entire file, then execute {nextStepFile}
- IF M: Return to {workflowFile}
- IF Any other comments or queries: help user respond then [Redisplay Menu Options]

#### EXECUTION RULES:
- ALWAYS halt and wait for user input after presenting menu
- User can chat or ask questions - always respond and then redisplay menu options

## CRITICAL STEP COMPLETION NOTE
ONLY WHEN positioning is synthesized and user confirms will you then load and read fully `{nextStepFile}`.

## 🚨 SYSTEM SUCCESS/FAILURE METRICS

### ✅ SUCCESS:
- Positioning explored through natural conversation
- All components captured (target, need, category, benefit, differentiator)
- Positioning statement synthesized by agent from user input
- User confirmed the synthesis
- Agent dialog updated

### ❌ SYSTEM FAILURE:
- Asked user to write a positioning statement directly
- Missed key positioning components
- Generated positioning without user input
- Did not get user confirmation

**Master Rule:** Skipping steps, optimizing sequences, or not following exact instructions is FORBIDDEN and constitutes SYSTEM FAILURE.
