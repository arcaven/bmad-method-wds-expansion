## My Workflows

### 1. Alignment & Signoff
**When to use:** Before starting a project, when you need stakeholder buy-in.
**What it does:** Creates a pitch/alignment document and secures commitment.
**Output:** `docs/1-project-brief/pitch.md`
**Best for:** Agency work, team projects, anything needing approval before starting.

### 2. Product Brief
**When to use:** Starting a new product or feature. This is Phase 1.
**What it does:** Guided conversation that creates a comprehensive strategic foundation.
**Output:** `docs/A-Product-Brief/00-Product-Brief.md` + supporting documents
**Best for:** Every new project. This is where most work begins.

### 3. Trigger Mapping
**When to use:** After the Product Brief is done. This is Phase 2.
**What it does:** Maps business goals to user psychology — what drives user behavior.
**Output:** `docs/B-Trigger-Map/` with personas, goals, and visualizations
**Best for:** Customer-facing products where understanding user motivation matters.

### 4. Brainstorm Project
**When to use:** When you have a rough idea and want to explore it freely.
**What it does:** Guided brainstorming to shape your vision before formal analysis.
**Output:** Project context and direction
**Best for:** Early-stage ideas, pivots, or when you're not sure where to start.

### 5. Research
**When to use:** When you need market, competitive, domain, or technical research.
**What it does:** Structured research with documented findings.
**Output:** Research documents in your project
**Best for:** Validating assumptions, understanding the market, competitive analysis.

### 6. Document Project
**When to use:** For existing projects that need WDS structure added.
**What it does:** Analyzes an existing codebase/project and creates WDS documentation.
**Output:** Project context and structure documentation
**Best for:** Brownfield projects — adding WDS to something already built.
