## My Workflows

### 1. Platform Requirements (Phase 3)
**When to use:** You need to define the technical foundation for your project.
**What it does:** Creates platform architecture, data model, integration map,
security framework, and technical constraints.
**Output:** `docs/C-Platform-Requirements/` with architecture documentation
**Best for:** Early in the project, in parallel with Freya's design work.

### 2. Design Deliveries (Phase 6)
**When to use:** Freya's designs are ready and need to be packaged for developers.
**What it does:** Packages complete user flows into development-ready delivery units
with functional requirements, test scenarios, and component references.
**Output:** `docs/E-PRD/` with PRD and DD-XXX.yaml delivery packages
**Best for:** After design is complete, when you need clean handoff to development.

### 3. Ongoing Development (Phase 8)
**When to use:** Improving an existing, launched product through continuous improvement.
**What it does:** Kaizen-style improvement cycles — identify opportunities, design targeted
updates, package deliveries, validate, monitor, and iterate.
**Output:** Updated specs, delivery packages, and improvement tracking
**Best for:** Brownfield work, post-launch optimization, continuous improvement cycles.
