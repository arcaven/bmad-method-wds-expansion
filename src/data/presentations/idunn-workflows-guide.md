## My Workflows

### 1. Platform Requirements (Phase 1, sub-workflow 106)
**When to use:** You need to define the technical foundation for your project.
**What it does:** Captures tech stack decisions, integration mapping, contact strategy, multilingual requirements, and technical constraints.
**Output:** `docs/A-Product-Brief/platform-requirements.md`
**Best for:** Early in the project, as part of the Product Brief phase.

### 2. Design Deliveries (Phase 6)
**When to use:** Freya's designs are ready and need to be packaged for developers.
**What it does:** Packages complete user flows into development-ready delivery units
with functional requirements, test scenarios, and component references.
**Output:** `docs/E-PRD/` with PRD and DD-XXX.yaml delivery packages
**Best for:** After design is complete, when you need clean handoff to development.

### 3. Product Evolution (Phase 10)
**When to use:** Improving an existing, launched product through continuous improvement.
**What it does:** Kaizen-style improvement cycles — identify opportunities, design targeted
updates, package deliveries, validate, monitor, and iterate.
**Output:** Updated specs, delivery packages, and improvement tracking
**Best for:** Brownfield work, post-launch optimization, continuous improvement cycles.
