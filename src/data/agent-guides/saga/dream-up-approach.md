# Saga's Dream Up Approach Guide

**When to load:** When user requests artifact generation (Trigger Map, Product Brief companions)

**Agent:** Saga the Analyst
**Purpose:** Execute Dream Up modes (Suggest/Dream) for Phase 1-2 artifact generation

---

## Core Architecture: 5 Layers

```
Layer 1: Learn WDS Form (Static - loaded once)
         How to structure, what makes quality
         ↓
Layer 2: Project Context (Cumulative - grows with each step)
         Product Brief → +Business Goals → +Target Groups → +Driving Forces
         ↓
Layer 3: Domain Research (Ongoing - per step as needed)
         Industry insights, competitor analysis, user behavior
         ↓
Layer 4: Generate Next Artifact
         Apply Form + Use All Prior Context + Enhanced by Research
         ↓
Layer 5: Self-Review Against Standards
         Check quality, identify gaps, refine
         ↓
    Add artifact to Layer 2 → Repeat for next step
```

**Key Principle:** Each step builds on all previous artifacts. Layer 2 grows as progress is made.

---

## When to Offer Dream Up Modes

### Offer When:
✅ User requests artifact generation (Trigger Map, Product Brief companions)
✅ Product Brief exists from Phase 1 (provides substance)
✅ Quality rubric exists for the artifact type
✅ Task is structured generation (not pure discovery)

### Don't Offer When:
❌ Pure discovery conversation (no artifact to generate)
❌ No Product Brief exists yet (no substance to work with)
❌ User explicitly wants dialog/workshop approach
❌ No quality rubric available yet

---

## Mode Selection Dialog

**Present this choice at workflow start:**

```
**Which engagement mode would you like?**

**Workshop Mode** (Agent facilitates workshop, 60-90 min)
- I'll facilitate a workshop to draw out your best ideas through strategic questions
- Man-in-the-loop: You're actively involved, I guide the discovery
- Best for: Discovery, strategic decisions, first time, want to go deep

**Suggest Mode** (Driven by agent, 30-45 min)
- I'll generate based on WDS methodology + your Product Brief + domain research
- You review each step and guide refinements
- You'll see my learning, research, and self-review process
- Best for: Product Brief exists, want to see my thinking, learn through observation

**Dream Mode** (Fully autonomous, 15-20 min)
- I'll generate autonomously with visible self-dialog
- You can observe and interrupt anytime, or just review the result
- Best for: Trust the methodology, established patterns, time-efficient

Choose: [W] Workshop | [S] Suggest | [D] Dream
```

**If user unsure, recommend based on:**
- Product Brief quality (rich → Suggest/Dream, sparse → Workshop)
- User skill level (beginner → Workshop, comfortable → Suggest/Dream)
- Time constraints (limited time → Dream)
- Novelty (new domain → Workshop, familiar → Suggest/Dream)

---

## Layer 1: Learn WDS Form (Static)

**Purpose:** Agent becomes WDS methodology expert before generating.

### For Phase 2 (Trigger Mapping)

**Load these WDS learning materials:**
```
docs/method/phase-2-trigger-mapping-guide.md
docs/quick-start/02-trigger-mapping.md
src/data/agent-guides/saga/trigger-mapping.md
docs/models/impact-effect-mapping.md
docs/method/dream-up-rubric-phase-2.md
```

**Learn and internalize:**

#### Structure Requirements
- Business Goals Layer (vision + SMART objectives)
- Product/Solution Hub
- Target Groups (3-4 max, prioritized)
- Detailed Personas (alliterative names, psychological depth)
- Usage Goals (positive + negative drivers, 3-5 each per persona)
- Prioritization (goals → groups → drivers ranked)
- Optional: Feature Impact Analysis, Visual Diagram

#### Quality Criteria (7 standards)
1. **Strategic Depth** - Reveal specific psychology, not surface observations
2. **Usage Context Clarity** - Usage goals, not life goals
3. **Persona Depth** - Psychological, not demographic
4. **Negative Drivers Present** - Equal weight to fears/frustrations
5. **Focused Scope** - 3-4 groups max, not diluted
6. **Actionable Specificity** - Concrete, not vague
7. **Business Goal Connection** - Every user serves a goal

#### Common Mistakes to Avoid
- ❌ Solutions on the map (keep psychology, not features)
- ❌ Generic/obvious forces (be specific to context)
- ❌ Demographic personas (focus on psychology)
- ❌ Inconsistent priority (make hard choices)

#### Best Practices
- ✅ Alliterative persona names (memorable, hints at role)
- ✅ Equal weight to negative drivers (loss aversion is powerful)
- ✅ Context declaration (explicit usage context)
- ✅ Visual connection diagram (shows logic flow)

**Document in agent dialog:**

```markdown
## Layer 1: WDS Form Learned

### Methodology Loaded
- Phase 2 Trigger Mapping Guide
- Quality Rubric with 7 criteria
- Impact/Effect Mapping model

### Structure Internalized
- 4 core layers: Goals → Product → Groups → Drivers
- Prioritization required at each level
- Personas with psychological depth, not demographics

### Quality Standards
- Minimum threshold: 7/9 complete, 5/7 quality, 4/4 mistakes avoided
- Excellence threshold: 9/9 complete, 7/7 quality, 4/4 practices followed

### Ready to apply WDS form to this project's substance.
```

---

## Layer 2: Project Context (Cumulative)

**Purpose:** Extract substance from prior artifacts. Layer 2 GROWS with each step.

### Initial Load: Product Brief (Start of Phase 2)

**Read these files:**
```
{output_folder}/A-Product-Brief/product-brief.md
{output_folder}/A-Product-Brief/content-language.md
{output_folder}/A-Product-Brief/platform-requirements.md
{output_folder}/A-Product-Brief/visual-direction.md
```

**Extract and summarize:**

#### Business Context
- Business name, location, industry, services
- Market position, reputation, years in business
- Current challenges (what problem does product solve)
- Success criteria (what winning looks like)

#### User Archetypes (from Product Brief)
- Each archetype name and description
- Their context (when do they use product)
- Their needs/goals (high-level)
- Their challenges (frustrations)

**Note:** These archetypes will be deepened into personas with driving forces in Phase 2.

#### Constraints
- Technical: Platform, tech stack, integrations
- Business: Budget, timeline, resources, maintenance level
- Scope: What's in/out
- Brand: Tone, personality, visual direction, keywords

#### Strategic Direction
- Business goals mentioned in brief
- Target audience priorities
- SEO keywords (if relevant)
- Future plans

**Document in agent dialog:**

```markdown
## Layer 2: Project Context (Initial Load)

### From Product Brief
**Business:** Källa Fordonservice AB, car mechanic on northern Öland, 20+ years, 4.8/5 rating
**Challenge:** Repetitive phone calls about basic info, no website presence
**Goal:** Reduce admin burden while maintaining findability

### User Archetypes (to deepen)
1. **Tomas the Tourist** - Summer visitor, car trouble, stressed, needs immediate help
2. **Lennart the Local** - Year-round resident, loyal customer, checks hours
3. **Farmer Fredrik** - Agricultural equipment, understands wait times
4. **Motorhome Maria** - RV passing through, specialized expertise needed

### Constraints
- Technical: WordPress + Tailwind, mobile-first, low maintenance
- Business: Björn at capacity, phone-first contact strategy
- Brand: Professional but unpretentious, warm and practical tone

### Strategic Direction
- Primary: Reduce repetitive info calls
- Secondary: Rank for "bilverkstad Öland" keywords
- Future: AI phone assistant integration
```

### Cumulative Growth: Add After Each Step

## Layer 4: Generate Artifact

**Purpose:** Create output by applying WDS Form (Layer 1) + Project Context (Layer 2) + Domain Research (Layer 3).

### Generation Process

**Synthesis Statement (before generating):**

```markdown
## Generation Plan: [Artifact name]

**Applying:**
- WDS Form: [Structure from Layer 1]
- Project Context: [All prior artifacts from Layer 2]
- Domain Research: [Insights from Layer 3]

**Expected Output:**
[What will be created, aligned to which criteria]
```

### Step-by-Step Generation

**For Phase 2 Trigger Mapping:**

#### Step 1: Business Goals

**Input:**
- Form: Vision + SMART objectives structure (Layer 1)
- Substance: Product Brief goals and success criteria (Layer 2)
- Research: Industry best practices for this business type (Layer 3)

**Generate:**
1. Vision statement (inspirational, directional)
2. 3-5 SMART objectives (measurable, time-bound)
3. Connection to product/solution

**Example Output Structure:**
```markdown
## Business Goals

### Vision
[Inspirational statement about where business is going]

### SMART Objectives
1. [Specific - Measurable - Achievable - Relevant - Time-bound]
2. [...]
3. [...]

### Product Connection
[How the product/website serves these goals]
```

#### Step 2: Target Groups

**Input:**
- Form: 3-4 groups max, prioritized, connected to goals (Layer 1)
- Substance: Product Brief archetypes + Business Goals (Layer 2)
- Research: Customer types for this industry + location (Layer 3)

**Generate:**
1. Refine Product Brief archetypes into strategic target groups
2. Connect each to business goals they serve
3. Prioritize: Primary 👥, Secondary 👤, Tertiary
4. Create detailed persona for each

**Persona Template (Psychological Depth):**
```markdown
### [Alliterative Name the Role]

**Context:** [When/why they use product - usage context, not life context]

**Psychological Profile:**
- Role: [Their position relative to product]
- Mindset: [How they think/feel in this context]
- Internal State: [Confidence, anxiety, urgency, etc.]

**What They're Trying to Achieve:**
[High-level goals in this usage context]

**What They Fear/Want to Avoid:**
[High-level fears in this usage context]

**Why They Matter to Business Goals:**
[Connection to specific SMART objectives]
```

#### Step 3: Driving Forces

**Input:**
- Form: Positive + negative drivers, equal weight, contextual (Layer 1)
- Substance: Personas + Business Goals (Layer 2)
- Research: User pain points, reviews, forums, behavior patterns (Layer 3)

**Generate for EACH persona:**

**Positive Drivers (✅ 3-5 per persona):**
- What they want to achieve (usage goals, not life goals)
- Specific to context (not generic "save time")
- Actionable (designer can create feature from this)

**Negative Drivers (❌ 3-5 per persona):**
- What they want to avoid (fears, frustrations)
- Specific and visceral (loss aversion is powerful)
- Equally detailed as positive drivers

**Example Format:**
```markdown
### Tomas the Tourist - Driving Forces

**Positive Drivers (✅):**
1. Get back on road quickly without ruining vacation plans
2. Feel confident that mechanic is certified and trustworthy
3. Understand what's wrong and what it costs before committing
4. Know exact timeline so can adjust other plans accordingly

**Negative Drivers (❌):**
1. Fear being stranded on vacation far from home
2. Fear getting ripped off by unknown mechanic in unfamiliar place
3. Avoid wasting vacation time waiting with no updates
4. Avoid surprise costs that blow vacation budget
```

#### Step 4: Prioritization

**Input:**
- Form: Rank goals, groups, drivers (Layer 1)
- Substance: All of above (Layer 2)
- Research: What matters most in this industry (Layer 3)

**Generate:**
1. Business Goals ranked (which matters most NOW)
2. Target Groups ranked (which impacts top goal most)
3. Driving Forces ranked per persona (top 3 most urgent)

**Output Strategic Focus Statement:**
```markdown
## Strategic Focus

**Priority 1 Goal:** [Top business objective]
**Priority 1 User:** [Primary persona]
**Priority 1 Drivers:** [Top 3 forces for primary persona]

This combination guides all design decisions.
```

## Tips for Quality Self-Review

### Be Honest, Not Optimistic
- Mark ⚠️ partial even if "pretty good"
- Mark ❌ gap if rubric shows higher bar
- Don't inflate scores to meet threshold faster

### Use Rubric Examples Directly
- Compare output to good/bad examples in rubric
- If matches "bad example" → ❌
- If between → ⚠️
- If matches "good example" → ✅

### Actionability Test
- Can designer create feature from this driving force?
- Would two designers interpret this persona the same?
- Can I trace this user to a specific business goal?

### Context is King
- "Want to save time" = ❌ Generic
- "Want to find phone within 3 seconds because stressed on vacation" = ✅ Contextual

### Psychology Over Demographics
- "Sarah, 35, consultant" = ❌ Demographic
- "Sophie struggles with imposter syndrome when presenting to executives" = ✅ Psychological
