# Value Trigger Chain (VTC)

**Removed** — The VTC concept has been removed entirely. The VTC Workshop and all related files were deleted in v0.3.0.

When a scenario or content piece needs strategic context, reference the Trigger Map directly — pick the relevant business goal, persona, and driving forces from the Trigger Map (Phase 2).

Phase 1 (Product Brief) is casual business discovery. Phase 2 (Trigger Mapping) is where strategic analysis happens. There is no separate "VTC" concept.

- [Phase 1: Product Exploration Guide](./phase-1-product-exploration-guide.md) — casual business discovery
