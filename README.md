# Whiteport Design Studio (WDS) — BMAD Expansion Module

**Strategic design methodology for creating products users love, powered by AI agents.**

This is the BMAD expansion module version of WDS. For the standalone installer, see [whiteport-design-studio](https://github.com/whiteport-collective/whiteport-design-studio).

---

## What is WDS?

WDS is a structured design methodology that uses AI agents to guide you through product design, from initial strategy to developer-ready specifications.

- **Strategic foundation** - Connect every design decision to business goals and user psychology
- **Complete specifications** - Generate developer-ready page specs with all details defined
- **AI-powered workflow** - Two specialized agents guide you through each phase
- **IDE-native** - Works inside your AI coding tool (Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, and 16 more)

## Agents

WDS uses two specialized AI agents (the Norse Pantheon):

| Agent | Role | What they do |
|-------|------|-------------|
| **Saga** (Analyst) | Business & Product Analyst | Product Brief (Phase 1), Trigger Mapping (Phase 2). Start here. |
| **Freya** (Designer) | UX/UI Designer & Developer | UX Scenarios (Phase 3), UX Design (Phase 4), Agentic Development (Phase 5), Asset Generation (Phase 6), Design System (Phase 7), Product Evolution (Phase 8) |

### Activating an agent

Tell your AI IDE:

```
Read and activate _bmad/wds/agents/saga-analyst.md
```

Saga will greet you by name and guide you through creating your Product Brief.

## Design Phases

| Phase | Focus | Agent | Output folder |
|-------|-------|-------|--------------|
| 0. Alignment & Signoff | Stakeholder alignment before starting | Saga | — |
| 1. Product Brief | Vision, positioning, success criteria | Saga | `A-Product-Brief/` |
| 2. Trigger Mapping | User psychology, business goals | Saga | `B-Trigger-Map/` |
| 3. UX Scenarios | Scenario outlines via 8-question dialog | Freya | `C-UX-Scenarios/` |
| 4. UX Design | Page specifications, interactions | Freya | `D-UX-Design/` |
| 5. Agentic Development | AI-assisted development & testing | Freya | `G-Product-Development/` |
| 6. Asset Generation | Visual and text assets from specs | Freya | — |
| 7. Design System | Component library, design tokens | Freya | `D-Design-System/` |
| 8. Product Evolution | Brownfield improvements | Freya | — |

Output folders are created inside your configured design artifacts directory (default: `design-artifacts/`).

## Supported Design Tools

WDS offers agentic design capabilities with several visual design and prototyping services:

| Tool | What it does | MCP |
|------|-------------|-----|
| **Figma** | Professional UI design, design system management | Figma MCP |
| **Pencil (Penpot)** | Open-source design tool, AI-assisted layout | Pencil MCP |
| **Stitch** | AI screen generation from text descriptions | Stitch MCP |
| **Excalidraw** | Wireframing and sketch analysis | — |
| **html.to.design** | Import HTML prototypes into Figma | Figma plugin |
| **NanoBanana** | AI image generation for brand exploration | — |

The design loop works with any combination: wireframe in Excalidraw, generate screens with Stitch or Pencil, refine in Figma, pull back via MCP.
